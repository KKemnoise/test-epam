# test-epam
jenkins-ansible script

Using a public AWS Cloud Free Tier, write Terraform Scripts to deploy an infrastructure and Ansible to configure the machines for:

Create a Jenkins instance.

Create some static or dynamic slaves.

Configure Jenkins integration with a GitHub repository, and implement basic CI on an example application.

Implementing a Declarative pipeline on a Jenkinsfile for the full SDLC will be a bonus.

All the environment should be properly secured.

Document everything (a nice documentation will be highly evaluated).

Store the Terraform and Ansible scripts, and all the configuration in GitHub repositories so we can evalute the exercise creating everything from scratch with your scripts.

Make sure you understand the free tier limitations, the exercise can be completed without incurring any cost.

Make sure you don't store CREDENTIALS or TOKENS on the GitHub repos, any cost related to not following good practices and get cloud account hacked will be candidate's responsibility
